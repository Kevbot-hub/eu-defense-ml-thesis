# Step-by-Step Plan for Machine Learning in Your Thesis (with Fully Integrated NLP)

---

## 1. Build Your Defense Integration Index (DII)

**A. Decide on Indicators:**
- Number of active PESCO projects (per country/year)
- National defense expenditure (%GDP, EUR/USD)
- Participation in joint EU operations/missions
- Defense-related EU budget contributions
- Troop contributions to EU missions
- *[Optionally: defense industrial cooperation, joint procurement, etc.]*

**B. Data Collection:**
- Sources: EEAS/PESCO, SIPRI, EU Open Data Portal, Eurostat, etc.
- Compile into a master DataFrame: **Country**, **Year**, chosen indicators.

**C. Data Cleaning:**
- Handle missing values, align units/names, normalize indicators.

**D. Construct the Index:**
- Normalize indicators (z-score or min-max).
- Combine with justified weights or simple average → get one “DII” value per country per year.

**E. Documentation:**
- Write out indicator choices, sources, normalization, weighting logic for your methods chapter.

## 2. Extract and Quantify U.S. Policy Signals via NLP

**A. Collect Policy Text Data:**
- Gather full texts of U.S. presidential speeches, State of the Union addresses, NATO communiqués, DoD/National Security documents, and other major policy statements (2009–2025).

**B. Preprocess and Clean Texts:**
- Clean, tokenize, remove stopwords, and lemmatize using tools like `nltk` or `spaCy`.

**C. Apply NLP Models to Policy Texts:**
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Assess each document for positive/negative stance toward EU/NATO/defense integration (using `TextBlob`, `VADER`, or `spaCy` sentiment models).
- **Topic Modeling:** Use `gensim` (LDA) to identify dominant policy themes or priorities (e.g., focus on “burden sharing,” “autonomy,” “NATO support”).
- **Keyword Frequency:** Quantify mentions of strategic terms reflecting U.S. commitment, support, or retrenchment.

**D. Aggregate Annual Policy Signal Features:**
- For each year, calculate the average sentiment, frequency of key topics, and relative importance of themes from all relevant U.S. policy documents.
- Create a **policy signal variable set** (e.g., annual sentiment score, topic prevalence, keyword frequency) to represent the U.S. policy climate for each year.

**E. Documentation:**
- Document all sources, preprocessing, modeling choices, and how policy signals are constructed, for transparency and replicability.

## 3. Prepare Final ML Dataset (Integrating Quantitative & NLP Features)

- Merge your DII index (dependent variable) with all independent variables:
    - Traditional quantitative measures (e.g., spending, PESCO projects, joint ops)
    - **NLP-derived policy signal features** (sentiment, topic prevalence, keyword counts per year)
    - Control variables (GDP, Russian threat, EU economic and political context)

---

## 4. Machine Learning Modeling

**A. Feature Engineering:**
- Create lagged/shifted variables to model temporal effects (e.g., effect of prior year’s U.S. policy sentiment on current DII).
- Scale or encode features as necessary.

**B. Model Selection & Training:**
- Use regression and ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and/or time series regressors (`Prophet`, `ARIMA`).
- Train and test models to predict DII for each country-year, with all quantitative and NLP-derived features included.

**C. Model Evaluation:**
- Use cross-validation, RMSE, and MAE to evaluate predictive performance.
- Analyze feature importances to see which policy signals (NLP features), economic indicators, or events are most influential.

## 5. Scenario Simulation and Strategic Foresight

- Construct alternative U.S. policy scenarios by varying NLP-derived features (e.g., simulating a period of negative policy rhetoric or increased NATO support).
- Use the trained model to forecast DII under these scenarios for future years.
- Visualize projected defense integration trajectories for the EU, highlighting sensitivity to shifts in U.S. rhetoric and policy tone.

## 6. Write-Up & Documentation

- **Methods:**
  - How DII was built and validated
  - How U.S. policy signals were extracted and quantified via NLP
  - Full modeling process and rationale
  - Scenario design and justification
- **Results:**
  - Key findings: historical drivers, impact of U.S. policy sentiment/themes, predicted DII under different scenarios
  - Feature importances
- **Discussion:**
  - Academic contributions (innovative use of NLP in IR, improved measurement of U.S. influence)
  - Policy recommendations for EU/NATO planners (how to respond to various U.S. policy climates)

## How This Strengthens Your Thesis

- **Academic Value:**  
  - Integrates advanced machine learning and NLP techniques into IR research, offering a robust, data-driven analysis of how both material and rhetorical U.S. policy shifts impact EU defense integration.
- **Practical Value:**  
  - Equips policymakers with nuanced, forward-looking models that capture not only what the U.S. does, but also how it communicates—providing a new angle for scenario planning.
- **Novelty:**  
  - Demonstrates interdisciplinary mastery, bridging quantitative modeling, text analysis, and international relations theory.
